-----------------------------------Traffic management-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anthos Service Mesh controls the flow of traffic between services, into the mesh (ingress), and to outside services (egress).
You configure and deploy Istio-compatible custom resources to manage this traffic at the application (L7) layer. For example, with the custom resources, you can:

----------Create canary and blue-green deployments.----------------------------
----------Provide fine-grained control over specific routes for services.------
----------Configure load balancing between services.---------------------------
----------Set up circuit breakers.---------------------------------------------

Anthos Service Mesh maintains a service registry of all services in the mesh by name and by their respective endpoints.
It maintains the registry to manage the flow of traffic (for example, Kubernetes Pod IP addresses).
By using this service registry, and by running the proxies side-by-side with the services, the mesh can direct traffic to the appropriate endpoint.

----------------------------------------------------Security benefits-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitigates risk of replay or impersonation attacks that use stolen credentials. Anthos Service Mesh relies on mutual TLS (mTLS) certificates to authenticate peers,
rather than bearer tokens such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Ensures encryption in transit. Using mTLS for authentication also ensures that all TCP communications are encrypted in transit.

Ensures that only authorized clients can access a service with sensitive data, irrespective of the network location of the client and the application-level credentials.

Mitigates the risk of user data breach within your production network. You can ensure that insiders can only access sensitive data through authorized clients.

Identifies which clients accessed a service with sensitive data. Anthos Service Mesh access logging captures the mTLS identity of the client in addition to the IP address.

All in-cluster control plane components and proxies use FIPS 140-2 validated encryption modules.

-------------------------------------------------Managed Anthos Service Mesh-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Managed Anthos Service Mesh consists of the managed control plane and the managed data plane. With managed Anthos Service Mesh, Google handles upgrades, scaling, 
and security for you, minimizing manual user maintenance. 

With the managed data plane enabled, Google installs an in-cluster controller that manages the sidecar proxies for you.
